Lab Style Guide
===============

-   Section titles are formatted as header 2, `##`, and followed by a blank 
    line.

-   Exercises are ordered lists (`1.`, `2.`, `3.`, ...), not lazy lists 
    (`1.`, `1.`, `1.`, ...) with two spaces after the dot (or one space for 
    numbers \> 9, < 100).  Subsequent lines are hanging-indented four spaces.
    
-   On Your Own questions are unordered lists (`-`, `-`, `-`, ...) with three 
    spaces following each `-`.

-   For nested lists, see the OYO in lab 6 for an example of the preferred 
    method.
    
-   All lists items should be followed by a blank line.
    
-   Wrap all lines, text and code, at 80 characters.  The counter can be found 
    in the lower left corner of the editor.  Long urls or strings that should 
    not be segmented can overflow as can lines of code that become confusing 
    when broken up.
    
-   In-text numbers and basic math operators are not marked up. Latex is used 
    for in-line mathematical variables (e.g. `$nS`, `$p$`) and more complex 
    symbols.  Full equations should be displayed on a separate line with `\[` 
    and `\]`.
    
-   Any in-text code is marked up with backticks.
    
-   Force a line break with a backslash `\\`.

-   The OYO section should be offset with a horizontal rule that precedes it. 
    For this, use `* * *`.
  
-   Don't embed links in text. Do this: "The BRFSS Web site ([http://www.cdc.gov/brfss]
    (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss))...". Not this: "The [BRFSS Web site]
    (http://www.cdc.gov/brfss)...". If teachers print the lab out, we want the 
    links to be visible.

-   For superscripts used in text, use HTML instead of Latex: <sup>th</sup>
